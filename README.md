## Portfolio

I'm a PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics at the University of Auckland and my research area is Dynamic Systems. In particular, my research focus is Chaos Theory, Bifurcation Theory and Numerical Methods in vector fields and maps. My academic journey is driven by a passion for visualising complex mathematical concepts and incorporating them into my research.<br>
Currently, my research centres on a higher-dimensional type of chaos called  <i>wild chaos</i>. Wild chaos is a new type of dynamics with specific robustness properties. My research aims to find the geometric mechanisms that generate this abstract type of chaos in an explicit system. I study how this type of chaos can be identified in applications by developing an advanced numerical methodin MATLAB for calculating long segments of stable and unstable manifolds in a three-dimensional Henon-like map.<br>
An essential ingredient in this context is a <i>blender</i>: a geometric object that appears to be higher-dimensional.  What does a blender look like? As a result of my research, the following picture shows an example of a blender obtained by computing its manifolds as a parameter is varied. This allows us to characterise  in a topological fashion the process of how exactly a blender emerges.
