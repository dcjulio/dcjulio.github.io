## Portfolio

I'm a PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics at the University of Auckland and my research area is Dynamic Systems. In particular, my research focus is Chaos Theory, Bifurcation Theory and Numerical Methods in vector fields and maps. My academic journey is driven by a passion for visualising complex mathematical concepts and incorporating them into my research.<br>
Currently, my research centres on a higher-dimensional type of chaos called  <i>wild chaos</i>. My research aims to find the geometric mechanisms that generate this abstract type of chaos in an explicit system. Moreover, I study how this type of chaos can be identified in applications by developing an advanced numerical method for calculating long segments of stable and unstable manifolds in a three-dimensional Henon-like map.
